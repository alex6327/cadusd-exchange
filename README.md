In the table view, users should be able to see data for the following columns: Date, Open Price, High Price, Low Price, Closing Price, and Adjusted Closing Price. Additionally, the table view should support infinite scrolling and a date range filter, allowing users to view a specific date range or all of the data.

In the charting view, the application should display the Open Price data and allow users to choose between two different chart types: Line chart and Area chart. The application should be compatible with Chrome, Edge, and Firefox browsers.
